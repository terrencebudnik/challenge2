// I tried to utilize flexboxes as much as possible to adjust to differing screen sizes but I may have been overly redundant

//The only link I did not provide a destination is for the phone number; I also just used a placeholder

//For the project section, I literally linked each one to the current page, as it's the only piece of coding examples I have completed
